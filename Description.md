# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS (DSA) + COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING (CP) - C++

Welcome to this repository!
This is a personal yet carefully maintained collection of my **originally solved coding problems in C++**, created with the intention of not just sharing solutions, but also **sharing understanding**.

---

## ✨ Why This Repository Exists

In many coding repositories, solutions are often shared without context — making them hard to learn from unless you already know the idea.
The goal of this repository is different.

🔹 Every solution here is written **from scratch**
🔹 Every problem focuses on the **core idea and intuition**
🔹 Emphasis is placed on **why** a solution works, not just **how**

This repository serves as:

* A **learning resource** for anyone studying Data Structures & Algorithms
* A **revision notebook** for interview preparation
* A **concept reference** for common patterns and problem-solving strategies
* A record of my **problem-solving journey in C++**

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

* ✅ Clean and readable **C++ implementations**
* 💡 Clear explanation of the **approach and logic**
* 🧩 Discussion of **edge cases and optimizations**
* ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)
* 📌 Problems inspired by platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and others

The focus is always on **clarity, correctness, and originality**.

---

## 🤝 Open for Discussion & Questions

If at any point:

* You find a solution hard to understand
* You think a step needs better explanation
* You have an alternative or optimized approach
* Or you simply want to discuss the idea behind a problem

👉 **Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.**

Learning improves when ideas are shared and questioned, and I genuinely welcome constructive discussions.

## 🌱 Who This Repository Is For

* Students learning **DSA with C++**
* Developers preparing for **coding interviews**
* Anyone who prefers **idea-first explanations**
* Learners who value **understanding over memorization**

---

## 📌 Final Note

This repository is not about showing “perfect” solutions —
it’s about **building strong fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving confidence**.

If this repository helps you understand even one concept better, then it has already achieved its purpose.

⭐ If you find it useful, consider starring the repository — it helps motivate continued learning and sharing.
